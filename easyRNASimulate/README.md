This is a practice for simulating FASTA data
To use:
	-g requires reference genome fasta file
	-e requires reference exon gtf file
	-o/-d requires output filename/directory
	-m requires integer for choosing mode
	-c requires integer for amount of reads
	-l requires integer for read length
	-circ needs double for scale of circ reads in spliced reads from 0.0 to 1.0
	-s needs double for scale of spliced reads from 0.0 to 1.0
	-b disable splice from the exon boundary
	-p enable pair end reads
	-h display the help note
